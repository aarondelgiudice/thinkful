    "\n",
    "If you were to ask Python to run a model, it doesn’t know what to do.\n",
    "If you were to just type into your environment \"Model my data, please\" your computer wouldn’t know what to do.\n",
    "It would come back with something to the effect of \"I don’t know what any of that means\", like maybe `-bash: Model: command not found`.\n",
    "Instead we (or someone who builds a package like scikit-learn) have to give Python a specific set of instructions to generate the model we want or find the best solution as we define it.\n",

    "__Algorithms__ are everywhere in data science.\n",
    "They are how we’ll sort lists, they are how we run tests, they are how we will build our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __algorithm__ is a set of instructions for a computer.\n",
    "Common non-computing examples include a set of driving directions (\"turn north on highway 101, then take the second left after the old oak tree\") or a recipe (mix the eggs and butter, then add to the dry ingredients).\n",
    "Whichever way you choose to describe it, __algorithms__ are how we get to computers to combine simple operations like basic maths or assigning values to variables into behavior capable of solving complex tasks like browsing the internet or predicting the future.\n",
    "We’ll rely on __algorithms__ to build models in this course.\n",
    "Throughout the course we’ll introduce some of the classic __algorithms__ of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like directions or a recipe, there are many ways to write an __algorithm__ that can give the same result.\n",
    "However, not all __algorithms__ are created equally, some are more efficient than others."

    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we think about the larger topic of __algorithmic efficiency__, we must first talk a little more about how __algorithms__ function.\n",
    "To do this we should think about steps or instructions.\n",
    "These are the things that the computer actually has to do when running your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be something simple, like this:\n",
    "    >>> 5 == 4\n",
    "    False\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a _n_ equality comparison of 5 to 4, and it takes the computer one step to check this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can do many things in a step.\n",
    "You can assign values to a variable, make a comparison between two numbers, change a variable’s value, look up the value of a list element at a specific index, or many more things.\n",
    "If it’s an active task for the computer it’s probably a step.\n",
    "Breaking down code into basic steps is an important exercise in __algorithm__ design because it allows us to see how efficient our code is and make sure it's as efficient as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be tempting to think of a line of code as a single step.\n",
    "However, not all lines of code behave the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "    >>> for i in numbers:\n",
    "    …     print(i > 4)\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    True\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a loop that will actually run multiple times.\n",
    "The code inside the loop represents a step that happens for each _element_ of the list `numbers` since the comparison against `4` happens for each element."

    "### Algorithmic efficiency and complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "So we’ve gone through some details in how computers actually move through an __algorithm__ and what it means for a computer to actually ‘do a thing’.\n",
    "The question that remains, of course, is why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could probably guess by the fact that we’re devoting a section to this that it matters.\n",
    "It matters a lot to data science in particular because we are often dealing with huge amounts of data.\n",
    "With a single observation a computer can get away with being inefficient and taking a significant number of steps to do something.\n",
    "The more data you have, however, that tolerance for inefficiency goes down.\n",
    "It starts to matter how much work it takes for a computer to work with large scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different kinds of __algorithms__ scale in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our comparative for loop, for example, scales linearly and is said to have _linear complexity_.\n",
    "Every additional element in the dataset, (our list numbers), adds an additional step to the __algorithm__.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let’s say we had a more complex loop:\n",
    "    >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    >>> \n",
    "    >>> for i in numbers:\n",
    "    …     for j in numbers:\n",

    "    False\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    False\n",

    "    True\n",
    "    False\n",
    "    [...17 more lines]\n",
    "\n",
    "This __algorithm__ no longer scales linearly.\n",
    "If we have one element in `numbers`, the print statement runs once.\n",
    "However, if we have two elements it runs four times and if we have three elements it runs nine times.\n",
    "Can you see the pattern? It scales according to the square of the length of `numbers`.\n",
    "This __algorithm__ has _quadratic complexity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this example may be trivial and not practical code to write, the concept is very much at the core of __algorithmic efficiency__.\n",
    "Different __algorithms__ see the number of steps they take grow at different rates and in different functional forms."

    "### Big O Notation\n",
    "_Big O Notation_ is the way to describe this scaling rate.\n",
    "For each particular __algorithm__ you can use _big O notation_ to describe a limiting functional form.\n",
    "As the number of elements in the __algorithm’s input__ grows, this notation shows the lower bound of performance.\n",
    "So something that is O(n) will be at worst n steps and O(n^2) is at worst n^2 steps.\n",
    "It is somewhat similar to a pizza delivery guarantee like 30 minutes or less.\n",
    "For something that is O(n), your __algorithm__ will run in n steps or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our first __algorithm__ above with linear complexity.\n",
    "It's described as O(n), where n is the length of the input list.\n",
    "Our second __algorithm__, the one with nested for loops and quadratic complexity, is O(n^2) where, again, n is the length of the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about _big O_, we only care about the things that grow most quickly as the dataset scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, look at the line y = 2 in the example below.\n",
    "    >>> y = 2\n",
    "    >>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    >>> for i in numbers:\n",

    "    True\n",
    "    True\n",
    "\n",
    "That line exists outside of the loop and will always be executed exactly once.\n",
    "The number of steps it represents doesn’t depend on how many items are in `n`.\n",
    "It's constant, while the steps inside the loop do scale with the size of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is that when we use _big O notation_ to refer to an __algorithm’s complexity__, we’re talking about how efficiently the __algorithm__ scales with additional data.\n",
    "For some datasets we can be ok with relatively inefficient __algorithms__, but in practice efficiency often matters because it sets an upper bound on the size of the dataset you can reasonably work with.\n",
    "In fact, sometimes you might even manually re-implement __algorithms__ you have access to with libraries like NumPy for efficiency reasons because your use case allows you to trim parts of the __algorithm__ away.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive into __algorithms__ and complexity, see this [optional extension](http://discrete.gr/complexity/).\n",
    "Throughout the course we’ll introduce the __algorithms__ that power some of our favorite models and talk about their complexity.\n",
    "We’ll also cover the topic of __algorithms__ in their own right towards the end of the course."
