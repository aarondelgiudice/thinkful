Advanced regression
Unit 3 / Lesson 3

Remember regression? The humble equation y = α + β1x turns out to be quite versatile.

In this section we'll introduce some new forms of regression, explaining how they differ from the multivariate linear regression you've already met.

Specifically, in this lesson we'll cover:
- Regression with binary outcomes
- Optimization methods beyond Least Squares
- Feature selection methods for regression
