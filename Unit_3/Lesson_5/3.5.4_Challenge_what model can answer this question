Challenge: what model can answer this question?

You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of exciting problems. To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor.


1. Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.
Linear regression

2. You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
Lasso regression will reduce the feature set.

3. Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
Any binary classifier, such as logit regression.

4. Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient
Naive bayes, or any other binary classifier

5. You have 1000+ features.
Random forest.

6. Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
Decesion tree.

7. Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500
Use cross validation.

8. Identify faces in an image.
Neural network for image recognition. Though this is an unsupervised learning application.

9. Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
Any model that supports a multinomial classifier.
