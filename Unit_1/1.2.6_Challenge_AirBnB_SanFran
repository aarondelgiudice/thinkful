Questions

Once you have your database set up, run some queries to start understanding San Francisco's Airbnbs. Here are some questions you should try to answer:

--What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

SELECT
	*
From
	sfo_listings
ORDER BY
	Price DESC
LIMIT
	1;


--What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

SELECT
	neighbourhood, COUNT(*)
FROM
	sfo_listings
GROUP BY
	neighbourhood
ORDER BY
	COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT
	1;


--What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco?

WITH
	listing_rate
AS
(SELECT
	ID, NAME, MIN(price)
AS
	price_min
FROM
	sfo_listings
GROUP BY
	1,2
ORDER BY
	price_min DESC)

SELECT
	calender_date, price_min
FROM
	listing_rate
JOIN
	sfo_calendar
ON
	listing_rate.id = sfo_calendar.listing_id


--What about the busiest?

WITH
	listing_rate
AS
(SELECT
	ID, NAME, MAX(price)
AS
	price_max
FROM
	sfo_listings
GROUP BY
	1,2
ORDER BY
	price_max DESC)

SELECT
	calender_date, (price_max)
FROM
	listing_rate
JOIN
	sfo_calendar
ON
	listing_rate.id = sfo_calendar.listing_id
